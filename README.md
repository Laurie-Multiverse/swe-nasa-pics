## Coach Notes

This week is all about UI testing. The big idea is that testing UI is about ensuring the components function as they should, and that this is a natural place to initiate end-to-end and integration tests.

There are many tools which are aimed at simulating user interaction directly, and many more which test components programatically. Several of these are compatible with familiar tools like jest and mocha.

## Things to see and do

The file has been configured to run Jest with React Testing Library. Some starter unit tests have been provided for you, but you shoudl feel empowered to add more! A few ideas:
- Create some additional unit tests that test functionality like:
    - Fetching a new picture for a new date and updating the corresponding mock data.
    - Testing that an image resizes when the slider value updates
    - Testing how errors are handled.
- Explore how to write end-to-end, integration, and component tests using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress).

## Next steps

Apprentices will be invited to choose a testing framework which corresponds to what is being used at work. There could be a decent chunk falling back to Jest and React Testing Library as there isn't much UI development at work. For several popular frameworks, some suggested front end testing libraries/frameworks have been provided.

Apprentices will be encouraged to get a project set up and start experimenting with the different levels of testing (unit, integration, and/or end-to-end). There is an assignment to test the Pokeverse application that they have been building throughout the last two weeks.
